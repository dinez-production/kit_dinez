Build a mobile card carousel that shows only the image card (no extra backgrounds).
Use the provided images at their exact intrinsic size — no zoom, no resize, no crop.
Remove the side white background and the thin background strip above the image so only the card is visible.
Each slide is a card with rounded corners and a soft shadow (still a card, not a flat/static image).

Behavior

One card per view. A single swipe always moves exactly one card.

Forward swipes (left→right): 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 (and so on).

Backward swipes (right→left): 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1.

Infinite loop:

From slide 5, a right→left swipe must smoothly wrap to slide 1.

From slide 1, a left→right swipe must smoothly wrap to slide 5.

The transition between neighboring cards must feel connected (cards visually “join” as they move).

Critical bug to fix (current issue)

When wrapping 5 → 1, there is a momentary flash where it briefly lands on 1, then instantly “replays” 5→4→3→2→1 in a millisecond.

Eliminate this glitch so the wrap 5 → 1 is a single, clean animation with no flicker, no double-landing, and no phantom pass through other slides.

Implementation requirements

Use the standard infinite-carousel pattern with cloned slides (clone of last before first, clone of first after last).

During a wrap:

Animate into the clone. On transitionend, instantly jump to the corresponding real slide without animation.

Use a transition lock (isTransitioning) so user input doesn’t trigger extra moves mid-transition.

Temporarily set transition: none, perform the index reset, then re-enable transition on the next animation frame (double requestAnimationFrame) to avoid reflow-induced flicker.

Use transform: translate3d(...) (GPU accelerated) and will-change: transform.

Compute slide width from getBoundingClientRect() after images load; update on resize.

Ensure each slide width is identical to the image width to prevent sub-pixel drift.

Passive touch listeners, pointer capture, and a velocity/threshold so quick swipes still advance one slide.

Container must be overflow: hidden; no scroll-snap; no auto-zoom.

Do not re-render or remount slides on each move; only update the translate value/index.

Acceptance criteria

No side white background or top strip—only the card is visible with rounded corners + shadow.

Images are displayed at original size (no zoom/resize).

Single-swipe → single-step movement.

Wraps 1 ↔ 5 are seamless: no flicker, no double jump, no phantom pass through intermediate slides.

Rapid swipes do not break the animation or index.
